## Atletas do Brasil - Search Engine for Brazilian Athletes

This is a basic web application that allows users to search for information about Brazilian athletes.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML:** The markup language used to structure the content and layout of the webpage.
* **CSS (assumed):** Likely used to style the appearance of the webpage elements (not included in this example).
* **JavaScript:** Used to implement the search functionality and manipulate the DOM.

### How the Application Works

1. **Search Bar:** The user enters a search term in the text field with the ID "campo-pesquisa".
2. **Search Button:** Clicking the button with the `onclick` attribute set to `pesquisar()` triggers the search function.
3. **Search Function (`pesquisar()`):**
    * Retrieves the search term from the input field.
    * Checks if the search term is empty. If so, displays a message indicating no search term was entered.
    * Converts the search term to lowercase for case-insensitive search.
    * Iterates through an assumed `dados` array containing athlete information objects (structure not provided).
    * For each object:
        * Converts the object's title, description, and tags (assumed property) to lowercase.
        * Checks if the search term is found anywhere (title, description, or tags) within the current object's information.
    * If a match is found, builds HTML code for the search result item with athlete details and a link.
    * Accumulates the search result HTML code in a variable (`resultados`).
    * If no matches are found, displays a message indicating no results were found.
4. **Displaying Results:**
    * Sets the inner HTML content of the element with the ID "resultados-pesquisa" to the accumulated search results (`resultados`).

### Additional Notes

* The code assumes the existence of a `dados` array containing information about athletes. The structure of this array is not provided in this example.
* Comments are included in both the HTML and JavaScript to explain the purpose of different sections and functionalities.
* You might need to create additional CSS styles to style the different webpage elements.
